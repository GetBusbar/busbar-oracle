"""Diff two shadow-oracle recordings cell by cell — the REPLAY half of the oracle.

  diff-cells.py --golden <dir> --candidate <dir> --out <dir> [--cells cells.json] [--family <regex>]

Reads <dir>/cells/<safe>.json (normalize.py output) from both recordings plus each side's
ledger.tsv. The OWED set is every cell id in cells.json (filtered) whose GOLDEN ledger row is PASS —
a cell the golden itself could not record is a named gap (owed-gaps.txt), never owed and never
green. For each owed id the candidate must have an identical normalized cell.

Divergence classes (a cell may carry several; the first names the earliest divergent layer):
  missing.golden      owed but the golden cell file is absent (recorder bug: red)
  missing.candidate   owed, golden present, candidate absent (the build did not serve it: red)
  status              HTTP status / exit code
  headers             header key set or value
  body                JSON: list of JSON-pointer paths with old/new; text/SSE: first differing line
  effects.usage       ledger delta differs (money)
  effects.usage_after_restart  the usage a script cell read back after a restart differs (money the
                      store was supposed to keep: a wrong-shaped store call loses it while every
                      request still answers 200)
  effects.store_errors  the number of `store error` lines a script cell's boots logged differs
  effects.files       the EXACT file set a script cell found in the directories it watched (the
                      process's working directory and the config's own directory). The contract is
                      an ABSENCE — a binary that writes a WAL, a keyset or a probe file where 1.5.5
                      wrote nothing serves every request identically while doing it, so nothing else
                      in the cell moves and only this class says so
  effects.metrics     metric delta differs
  effects.audit       audit delta differs
  effects.stderr      exec cells: the process's stderr (boot refusals, warnings, CLI errors)
  effects.script      EVERY OTHER effects key. A script cell writes the evidence its cell is about
                      straight into `effects` under a name of its own choosing — `survived`,
                      `key_after_restart`, `validate_exit`, `hazard_lines`, `usage_before`/`usage_after`,
                      `list_plugins` — and the classes above name only nine FIXED keys, so none of
                      that was compared by anything. 14 golden cells carry such a key that no other
                      class mirrors, so a build that lost the store across a restart
                      (plugins.store-persist|store-sqlite's `survived` / `key_after_restart`), leaked a
                      hazard line (hazard|no-data-dir's `hazard_lines`) or moved the usage view a
                      refusal was measured against (teller|admit-refusal's `usage_before`/`usage_after`)
                      diverged on nothing the differ computed and its row printed `PASS  identical`.
                      Rated MONEY: only a `breaking` entry naming its changelog line may forgive it
  norm.rules          the set of normalizer rules that fired differs (a rule firing on ONE side is
                      itself a finding: something non-deterministic appeared or disappeared)

Writes <out>/report.json, <out>/report.md, <out>/owed.txt, <out>/owed-gaps.txt, <out>/diverging.txt
and prints one TSV row per owed id on stdout: <id> <TAB> PASS|FAIL <TAB> <classes> <TAB> <first-diff>
(the driver turns those into ledger rows via fleet-fixtures/lib.sh `record`).
Exit 0 always — the VERDICT is verdict.sh's job, not this file's.

# ── THE ONE EXEMPTION FROM `norm.rules`, AND THE ONLY KIND OF RULE ALLOWED INTO IT ───────────────
# `norm.rules` exists because a normalizer rule that fires on ONE side is itself a finding: content
# was rewritten on the candidate that was not rewritten on the golden, and the rewrite is exactly
# where a real divergence goes to hide. ORDER_RULES is the single exemption — a RE-SORT changes no
# content at all, so whether a map happened to come out sorted on one run is not a contract.
#
# It was a bare set literal INSIDE compare(), hand-copied from normalize.py's rule list, and it had
# already drifted: normalize.py grew `boot.exhaustion-order` (sort_pool_lines, a third sort_runs
# call) and this set was never told, so that rule counted as one-sided. That drift was the harmless
# direction. The other direction is not: the membership test here is a plain name match, so putting
# a rule that DROPS or BLANKS content into this set — metrics.timing (drops a key), metrics.shape
# (drops lines), body.keep-lines (keeps only matching lines), hdr.retry-after (blanks a value) —
# would make its one-sided firing invisible, and a one-sided firing of a rule that removes content
# is precisely how a money figure leaves a cell without a class saying so.
#
# So the two kinds are named separately and asserted disjoint at import. A re-sort rule may be
# exempted; a rule that removes or rewrites content may never be, whatever it is called. Adding a
# CONTENT_RULES name to ORDER_RULES stops this file from loading rather than quietly widening the
# exemption. replay-selftest.sh holds the set to normalize.py's ACTUAL re-sort rules as well, so
# drift in either direction is red rather than merely lucky.

# `stderr.platform-capability` drops lines that report what the RECORDING MACHINE can do (see
# normalize.py). Such a rule is ASYMMETRIC BY CONSTRUCTION: the golden is recorded on darwin, where
# jemalloc cannot start its purge thread, and the CI candidate runs on linux, where the same binary
# never prints the line. The rule therefore fires on the golden side and not the candidate side on
# every cell that carries a boot log — which is the correct outcome, and which `norm.rules` would
# report as 56 divergences about the difference between two laptops.
#
# It is NOT put in ORDER_RULES. ORDER_RULES means "changes no content", and this rule removes a line;
# the disjointness assert above exists precisely so that a stripping rule cannot be smuggled into the
# exemption, and quietly reclassifying this one to buy silence is the move that assert is there to
# stop. So it gets its own category, with a different and weaker promise: its one-sided firing does
# not make a cell RED, and is REPORTED on the cell's row regardless — including on a cell that is
# otherwise green, which is the case the ordinary `detail` channel drops on the floor.
#
# The bar for adding a name here is not "this is noisy". It is: the line is emitted by the host's

# about it. Anything a request can influence belongs in norm.rules where it can be red.

    # class, no line anywhere. Three real things wear that shape and all three matter —
    #
    #   * a cell that exists in cells.json but which the GOLDEN could not record (a named gap). The
    #     candidate can record it fine, which is precisely the evidence that the gap has closed, and
    #     the gap register is where that belongs. Today it is simply not mentioned.
    #   * a cell id that is in NEITHER the golden's owed set nor cells.json — a RENAME. The old id
    #     leaves the corpus (see the owed-baseline check in replay.sh) and the new one lands here.
    #     Reporting only the disappearance names half of a rename and makes it look like a deletion.
    #   * a stale file from an EARLIER recording into the same --out (record.sh does not clear the
    #     directory per run for cells it did not select), which is a candidate carrying cells no
    #     binary in this run produced.
    #
    # It is its own class and NOT a member of CLASS_ORDER: CLASS_ORDER names ways an owed cell can
    # DIVERGE, each with a weight, a money rating and a `compare` policy, and nothing was compared
    # here at all. So it is reported — on its own row, in its own file, in report.json and report.md
    # — and it is not red unless a caller asks (--refuse-extra-candidate). Silence was the bug; red
    # would be a false one, because a candidate recording more than the golden owes is usually the
