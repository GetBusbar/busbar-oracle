# The shadow oracle's busbar CONFIGURATION + KEY MINTING — the setup half of record.sh / replay.sh,
# lifted out so the recorder and the replayer start busbar IDENTICALLY (the same config is the only
# way an old-vs-new byte-diff means anything). Sourced, not executed. Builds on fleet-fixtures/lib.sh.
#
#   oracle_write_config <work> <listen_port> <admin_port> <mock_port>
#       writes <work>/providers.yaml + <work>/config.yaml + <work>/signing.key
#         - six providers, one per LLM dialect, ALL pointing at the multi-dialect mock upstream, so a
#           request whose ingress dialect != the target model's provider dialect is a CROSS-PROTOCOL
#           cell (the LLM plane's defining feature) and the diagonal is the codec's own round trip;
#         - governance ON (keys auth chain), admin API on a token, prometheus export for /metrics;
#         - three budget groups: `oracle` (loose), `broke` (requests: 1/day + a 1-cent/day budget) and
#           `broke-quota` (a 1-cent/day budget ONLY, no requests cap) so after the recorder's one
#           PRIMING request the over-budget refusal is a REAL 429 at Admit — `broke` always blocks on
#           its `requests` cap first (governance::state checks requests before budget), so only
#           `broke-quota`'s bucket can ever surface the group's own BUDGET exhaustion (metric: budget).
#   oracle_mint_keys <admin_port>
#       mints the four principals every outcome class needs and exports:
#         ORACLE_TOKEN_OK / ORACLE_KEY_OK         normal key, group `oracle`
#         ORACLE_TOKEN_BROKE / ORACLE_KEY_BROKE   group `broke`        -> 429 over_budget (requests cap) at Admit
#         ORACLE_TOKEN_QUOTA / ORACLE_KEY_QUOTA   group `broke-quota`  -> 429 over_budget_total (budget cap) at Admit
#         ORACLE_TOKEN_NOSCOPE / ORACLE_KEY_NOSCOPE allowed_pools limited to a pool no cell uses -> 403
#
# The six model names are `m-<dialect>`; a cell targets `m-<egress_dialect>` so the LANE selects the
# egress codec while the request PATH selects the ingress codec.

# An ARRAY (not a space-separated string): this file is sourced under bash in CI and may be sourced
# under zsh on a laptop, and zsh does not word-split an unquoted scalar — the six dialects would
# collapse into one key. "${ORACLE_DIALECTS[@]}" iterates correctly in both.

# ── The fixture gate ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A cell's `needs_fixture` says its fixture is absent, in one of two shapes:
#
#   true              flat: nothing in the tree supplies it and no environment can, so the cell is
#                     always a named gap.
#   <ENV_VAR_NAME>    env-gated: that variable carries the fixture (a backend connection URL), and
#                     the cell is a named gap only while the variable is unset or empty.
#
# Absent / false / null mean the cell is recordable. This lives here, rather than inline in
# record.sh, so the recorder and fixture-gate-selftest.sh decide with the SAME code: a gate whose
# test reimplements it is a gate whose test can go on agreeing with a version that no longer runs.
# Exit 0 = the fixture is missing (skip the cell); exit 1 = record it.
#
# DEFINED BEFORE THE SELFTEST BLOCK BELOW, which `exit`s on a direct `--selftest` run: a function
# declared after it would never exist on that path.
#
# ── THREE ANSWERS, BECAUSE THERE ARE THREE CASES ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0  the fixture is MISSING — record the cell as a named gap
#   1  RECORD the cell
#   2  the value is not a fixture gate at all — REFUSE the cell; it is neither recordable nor a gap
#
# The third one is new and it is the finding. The env-gated arm was `[ -z "${!1:-}" ]`, and `${!1}`
# demands a valid shell identifier. record.sh stringifies whatever the corpus author wrote
# (`(.needs_fixture // false) | tostring`), so the argument can be any string — and on a value like
# `a backend URL` bash 5.3 prints "invalid variable name" and ABORTS THE ENCLOSING COMPOUND COMMAND.
# In record.sh that compound command is
#
#     if oracle_fixture_missing "$needs_fixture"; then record … SKIP …; continue; fi
#
# so NEITHER BRANCH RUNS, the `continue` is never reached, and execution falls through to the line
# below it: THE CELL IS RECORDED, WITH ITS FIXTURE ABSENT. record.sh runs under `set -uo pipefail`
# with no `-e`, so nothing stops the run. Whatever a busbar with no backend produces — a 500, a boot
# refusal, an empty store — is then frozen into the golden as that cell's honest answer with a PASS
# row, and the candidate reproduces it exactly. Reproduced on bash 5.3.15.
#
# A numeric value is the same hole by a different route: `needs_fixture: 1` makes `${!1}` indirect
# onto the POSITIONAL parameter `$1` — which is the value itself, non-empty — and the cell records.
#
# So the name is validated before it is dereferenced, and a value that is not a valid identifier is
# not guessed at: an unrecordable cell recorded anyway is the one outcome worse than a red row.
