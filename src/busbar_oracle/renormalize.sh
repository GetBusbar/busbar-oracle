  # ── FAITHFUL TO THIS CELL'S OWN RECORDER CALL SITE, OR REFUSED ────────────────────────────────
  # This file's whole claim is that it re-derives a cell "exactly as record.sh passes it". record.sh
  # does NOT have one normalize.py invocation; it has four, and they pass different flags:
  #
  #   driver      record.sh call site           passes
  #   http        record.sh:984                 --key-id, --keep-body-lines, --keep
  #   exec        record.sh:526                 --keep-body-lines, --keep      (no --key-id)
  #   concurrent  record.sh:740                 --key-id, --driver concurrent  (no keep spec)
  #   script      record.sh:825                 nothing at all
  #
  # Passing all three uniformly, as this loop did, means a `keep` or `body_lines` on a script or
  # concurrent cell is applied HERE and was never applied by the recorder: the re-normalized cell is
  # not the cell record.sh made, it is written over the golden in place, and the harness_rev
  # re-stamp at the bottom of this file then makes the rewrite look like a legitimate re-derivation.
  # Today no script or concurrent cell declares either spec, so the old code was faithful by luck
  # and not by rule; the day one does, the golden changes and nothing says so.
  #
  # So the flags are chosen by the cell's driver, and a spec the recorder's call site would have
  # IGNORED is a refusal naming the cell — never silently applied here, and never silently dropped
  # either, because "cells.json says keep this and the recording did not" is a discrepancy the
  # operator has to resolve in cells.json or in record.sh, not one this file may paper over.

# ── THE RECORDING NOW SAYS WHICH HARNESS PRODUCED THE CELLS IT HOLDS ─────────────────────────────
# renormalize.sh is itself in the harness-rev file set (it decides what a recording's cells say), so
# a recording it has rewritten was NOT produced by the harness its meta.json still names. Left
# unstamped, the recording carries the rev of the run that recorded it while holding cells this
# revision of normalize.py wrote — and diff-cells' skew guard, whose entire job is to refuse a pair
# of recordings made under different harnesses, compares the two stale stamps, finds them equal and
# says nothing. The rewrite is invisible in exactly the field that exists to make it visible.
#
# So the rev is re-stamped here, and the OLD one is pushed onto harness_rev_history (the same place
# a re-record puts it) with a note naming this script and how many cells it rewrote. Nothing else in
# meta.json is touched: `recorded`, `at`, `binary_sha256` and `binary` still describe the recording
# run, because that run is still what produced the raw captures.
