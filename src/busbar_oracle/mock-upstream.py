"""A DETERMINISTIC multi-dialect LLM upstream for the shadow oracle.

The oracle records busbar's exact bytes for every (ingress dialect, egress dialect, outcome) cell.
For that to be byte-stable across runs and binaries, the upstream must be a pure function of the
request: fixed ids, fixed usage (11 in / 7 out), a fixed marker text, no clocks, no randomness.

It answers in the dialect the REQUEST PATH selects (busbar's egress lane decides the path), so one
process serves all six egress dialects:

  anthropic         POST /v1/messages
  openai-chat       POST /v1/chat/completions
  openai-responses  POST /v1/responses
  gemini            POST /v1beta/models/<model>:generateContent | :streamGenerateContent
  bedrock           POST /model/<model>/converse | /converse-stream
  cohere            POST /v2/chat

Outcome controls (the recorder sets them per cell):
  header  X-Oracle-Upstream: down   -> 503 with a fixed body (drives busbar's failover / upstream-error path)
  header  X-Oracle-Upstream: slow   -> reserved (timeout cells), currently same as down
  header  X-Oracle-Upstream: 401    -> 401 with a fixed body (the member's credential is rejected: a hard-down)
  header  X-Oracle-Upstream: stream-error
                                    -> a 200 stream that FAILS PART WAY THROUGH: the dialect's normal
                                       events up to and including the text delta, then an IN-BAND error
                                       event in that dialect's own error shape, and no terminal usage /
                                       [DONE] frame. Distinct from `cut`, which kills the socket with no
                                       error at all: here the upstream says WHY, in band, after the
                                       response has already begun — so the door cannot answer with a
                                       status code and has to translate the failure into its own stream
  header  X-Oracle-Upstream: citation
                                    -> the BUFFERED Responses answer, ANNOTATED: the same text, plus a
                                       URL citation written in the FLAT spelling the published
                                       UrlCitationBody declares (url/title/start_index/end_index on the
                                       annotation itself, not nested under `url_citation`). Every other
                                       dialect and every stream builder is byte-identical under it
  body    {"stream": true} (openai/anthropic/cohere) or the *stream* path (gemini/bedrock)
                                    -> a fixed SSE / streamed sequence in that dialect

Usage: mock-upstream.py <port> [marker] [control-file]

<control-file> is the third positional every caller in this tree actually passes (record.sh and the
script cells under scripts/): the path of a file the RECORDER writes between requests to select the
outcome for the next cell. It carries either a bare verb (down | 429 | 5xx | 401 | slow | cut,
applying to every model) or JSON {"<model>": "<verb>", ...} with "*" as the fallback — the same
vocabulary as the X-Oracle-Upstream header above, but chosen OUT OF BAND so busbar's own request is
byte-identical to the healthy cell it is being compared against. Absent file means a healthy
upstream; the recorder removes it again once the cell is captured. A FOREIGN mock answering on this
port would ignore the file entirely and serve every outage cell healthy, which is why record.sh
proves the port's owner is its own pid before it records anything.

Egress capture (opt-in, for proving what busbar actually SENT upstream — not just what came back):
  When the environment variable ORACLE_MOCK_CAPTURE_DIR is set, every handled request (whatever the
  outcome — 200, a control-file failure, a 404 for an unrouted path, all of it) is written as its own
  JSON file in that directory, named "<ns>-<pid>-<seq>.json" where <ns> is a nanosecond timestamp, so
  that filenames sort in request order. Each file holds exactly:
    {"path": <raw request path, unmodified>, "method": "POST",
     "headers": {<lowercased header name>: <value>, ...}, "body": <utf-8 str, or "base64:..." if not>}
  This lets a recorder that snapshots the directory's filename list immediately before issuing a
  request, and again immediately after, take "the filenames present after that weren't present
  before" (sorted, so ordering is preserved for cells that fire more than one egress request) as the
  egress record(s) for that one cell — no other coordination needed. When the env var is unset
  (the default), nothing is captured and this mock's behaviour is unchanged.
