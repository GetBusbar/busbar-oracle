"""Normalize a captured oracle cell so a byte-diff is MEANINGFUL.

A response is only comparable across runs/binaries if the nondeterminism busbar legitimately emits
is stripped — and ONLY that. Every rule here is NAMED, and the normalizer records which rules fired,
so a change to the normalizer is itself reviewable (a rule that hides a real diff would show up as a
new rule firing where it did not before).

What is normalized (each rule is a named entry in `applied`):
  hdr.date            Date / Server / x-request-id / traceparent / busbar;dur timing header values
  id.wire             busbar-SYNTHESIZED wire ids: req_<hex>, resp_<hex>, msg_<hex>, chatcmpl-<hex>,
                      gemini/bedrock request ids (random bytes, hex) -> "<ID>"
  ts.unix             `created`/`timestamp`/`ts`/`at` integer unix seconds/millis -> 0
  ts.usage-window     a `/usage` body's `window.start` / `window.end` (the UTC day boundary the
                      window was computed against, not a contract of busbar's) -> 0; scoped to the
                      `window` object only, so no other `start`/`end` key in any other body is touched
  audit.hash          audit-chain hashes / seals (hex >= 32) -> "<HASH>"; sealed timestamps -> 0
  metrics.absolute    metrics are captured as DELTAS by the recorder; absolutes never enter a golden
  metrics.timing      duration _sum / quantile / histogram-bucket samples DROPPED (the _count stays)
  metrics.cooldown    a cooldown/breaker metric sample KEEPS its key (presence/absence is the
                      state-transition contract a cooldown-family cell proves) but its value — a
                      jittered base_cooldown_secs — is normalized to "<JITTER>"
  hdr.retry-after     Retry-After value -> "<RETRY>" (presence is the contract; the value is clock/jitter)
  id.wire also maps v4 UUIDs -> "<UUID>"; header values get the same id rules as bodies
  key.id              the minted key id (differs per run) -> "<KEY>"  (recorder passes the real id)
  hdr.etag            ETag values -> "<ETAG>" (content-derived; the content carries per-run ids)
  boot.pool-order     the boot banner's `pool /x = [...]` lines are emitted in map order, which is
                      nondeterministic on the SAME binary (measured on 1.5.5) -> sorted in place
  boot.error-order    `--validate` error bullets (`  - …`) come out in map order, nondeterministic on
                      the SAME binary (measured on 1.5.5: 3/6 runs each way) -> each run sorted in place
  keys.order          admin key listings (`items[]` whose ids are `vk_…`) are in creation-id order,
                      which is per-run -> sorted by name
  id.wire also maps minted bearer secrets `bbk_…` -> "bbk_<TOKEN>" (so no secret enters a golden)
  metrics.shape       a /metrics exposition body keeps its SHAPE (names, types, labels, counts):
                      latency samples (quantiles, _sum, _bucket, raw _seconds) are DROPPED, blank
                      separators dropped, and lines sorted (registry order is per-binary, not a contract)
  hdr.length          Content-Length -> "<LEN>" whenever a body rule fired (the length is the
                      shadow of a value that was just normalized, e.g. a latency or an id)
  boot.pair-order     "(A vs B)" conflict pairs in validation messages come out in map order,
                      nondeterministic on the SAME binary (measured on 1.5.5: 3/6 each way) -> sorted
  boot.exhaustion-order the boot banner's "pool exhaustion policy pool=<name> on_exhausted=<mode>"
                      lines (one per pool with an `on_exhausted:`) come out in map order, which is
                      nondeterministic on the SAME binary (measured on 1.5.5: two runs on the same
                      oracle config gave different orderings) -> each run sorted in place
  info.uptime         `uptime_seconds` (GET /api/v1/admin/info) -> 0: how long the process has been
                      up is a measurement of the recording, not of the binary — it read 0 or 1
                      depending on whether the cell was reached inside the first second of the boot.
                      Only the numeric VALUE; an openapi schema's `uptime_seconds` property is a
                      dict and stays exactly as documented.
  ver.string          `"version": "X.Y.Z"` of the binary -> "<VERSION>" (the diff of interest is
                      everything else; the version itself is expected to differ)
  body.keep-lines     a cell whose contract is the ABSENCE of something (`body_lines` on the cell)
                      keeps only the body lines matching that regex; an empty result is the
                      contract, and any surviving line is a diff
  keep.header-min     a cell's `keep.headers_min` pins a floor: the value becomes >=N when it clears N
  keep.header         a cell's `keep.headers` names a header that would otherwise be stripped/blanked
                      (Date, Retry-After, x-request-id, ...): its value is kept (still id-normalized)
                      instead, because for THIS cell the header's presence/value IS the contract
  keep.json_key       a cell's `keep.json_keys` names a dotted JSON path (list indices omitted, so
                      "items.digest" matches every element of an `items` array) whose value is kept
                      completely raw -- no id/ts/version scrubbing at or under that key -- because
                      for THIS cell that literal value IS the contract
  keep.text_regex     a cell's `keep.text_regex` names a line pattern in a /metrics exposition that
                      would otherwise be dropped by metrics.shape (a quantile/duration sample): the
                      line is kept with its trailing numeric sample value blanked to "<DUR>" (labels,
                      e.g. quantile="0.5", stay byte-exact) because for THIS cell the label SET is the
                      contract, not the timing value
  egress.cred         in effects.egress[].headers, the VALUE of an Authorization / x-api-key /
                      x-goog-api-key header, or of any header whose value is an AWS SigV4
                      "AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=..." string -> "<CRED>" (the credential differs
                      per run/environment; whether it rode upstream at all, and everything else
                      about the egress request, is deliberately left byte-exact so this cell can
                      catch a dropped tool list, a mangled system prompt, an injected max_tokens, or
                      a client header that leaked upstream when it should not have)
  text.port           127.0.0.1:<port> in any text body or stderr line: listen, admin and mock ports are the harness's
  egress.host         effects.egress[].headers.host: the mock's port becomes <PORT> (chosen per recording)
  stderr.platform-capability
                      whole stderr LINES that report a capability of the RECORDING HOST rather than
                      anything busbar did — today exactly one: darwin's "[warn] could not enable
                      jemalloc background purge thread ...", which the same binary does not print on
                      linux. It sat in 56 golden cells, so the committed golden and a linux CI
                      candidate differed on those cells by a fact about the machine that recorded
                      them. The patterns are ANCHORED and match a whole line; a keyword or a
                      severity match would also swallow a refusal, which is the one thing in stderr
                      the oracle exists to compare. stderr ONLY — a body is busbar's answer.
  metrics.concurrent-attempts
                      on a `concurrent` cell ONLY (--driver concurrent), the VALUE of every
                      busbar_upstream_attempts_total series -> "<ATTEMPTS>". The recorder fires N
                      requests at once and the closing scrape does not see N workers' increments at
                      one instant: the published 1.5.5 binary records 3, 1, 1, 1 for the same cell
                      across four runs. The KEY stays (a series that stops being published is a real
                      regression), and every other series in the delta — busbar_requests_total, the
                      per-key and per-bucket series — plus the usage row are compared byte for byte.
                      On every other driver the attempts value is single-threaded and IS compared.
  egress.elapsed      effects.egress[].response.elapsed_ms (how long the upstream took to answer that
                      one attempt) -> `elapsed`, one of "<1s" / "1-5s" / ">5s". The raw millisecond
                      count is a measurement of the recording host; the BUCKET is the contract, and
                      `route.failover|fo|primary-slow` is named for it. The mock records the raw
                      value so renormalize.sh can re-derive the bucket; the boundaries live here.
                      `status` and `retry_after` beside it are NOT normalized: a dropped Retry-After
                      or a changed status is exactly the divergence these cells exist to catch.
  eventstream.frames  a body whose Content-Type is `application/vnd.amazon.eventstream` (Bedrock's
                      binary framing for a streamed Converse) is DECODED rather than read as text.
                      Before this rule the bytes were run through `.decode("utf-8", "replace")`,
                      which is lossy in both directions: every non-UTF-8 framing byte — the two
                      big-endian lengths, the prelude CRC, the message CRC, the header block's
                      type/length bytes — collapsed to U+FFFD, so two DIFFERENT frame streams could
                      normalize to the same golden text, and the JSON payload inside each frame was
                      never seen by the JSON path at all (its `metrics.latencyMs`, a per-run
                      measurement, sat in the golden as a literal). The oracle was blind inside the
                      frames on exactly the five `llm|bedrock|*|ok_stream` cells.
                      The rule decodes the whole message stream: for each frame the 12-byte prelude
                      (total_length, headers_length, prelude CRC32), the header block (all nine AWS
                      header value types), the payload, and the trailing message CRC32 — and it
                      VERIFIES both CRCs, so a corrupted stream cannot decode into a clean-looking
                      list. Each payload is then normalized through the ordinary JSON path, so every
                      existing rule applies inside a frame exactly as it does to an unframed body
                      (`metrics.timing` on `latencyMs`, `ts.unix`, `id.wire`, ...).
                      The body is represented as the ordered list of `[event-type, payload]` pairs
                      with the framing DROPPED: lengths and CRCs are a re-encoding of the payload
                      and its headers, not a busbar contract, and keeping them would re-introduce
                      the per-run noise the payload rules just removed. Frame ORDER is kept, because
                      the order of a stream's events is a contract. The event-type is the frame's
                      `:event-type` header; a frame that carries none (an exception frame) is keyed
                      by its `:exception-type`/`:error-code`, else its `:message-type`, so an error
                      frame can never be mistaken for a nameless event.
                      A body that claims the content-type but does NOT decode (bad CRC, truncated
                      frame, unknown header type) does not silently fall back and disappear: the
                      rule records `eventstream.undecodable` instead and the old text path runs, and
                      because the applied-rule SET is itself a diff class (`norm.rules`), one side
                      decoding where the other does not is red on its own.
  egress.body         effects.egress[].body is parsed as JSON and re-serialized canonically (same
                      technique as a response body) so key order/whitespace cannot masquerade as a
                      diff; a non-JSON body is left untouched. No id/timestamp scrubbing rule from
                      the list above is applied to an egress body or to any non-credential egress
                      header — that is the point: this is the one place in the normalizer that must
                      stay maximally strict

Usage: normalize.py <captured.json> [--key-id <id>] [--keep-body-lines <regex>] [--keep <json>] > normalized.json
  --keep '<json>': per-cell opt-in that OVERRIDES the default stripping named above for named parts
    of THIS cell only: {"headers": ["retry-after", ...], "json_keys": ["info.version", ...],
    "text_regex": "..."}. Absent (the default): behavior is unchanged from before this flag existed.

Anything NOT listed is preserved byte-for-byte. Body JSON is re-serialized canonically (sorted keys,
no whitespace) so that key order — which is NOT semantically meaningful and which serializers may
vary — cannot masquerade as a diff. Non-JSON bodies (SSE) are normalized line-wise with the same
id/timestamp rules.

Usage: normalize.py <captured.json> [--key-id <id>] > normalized.json

# failover cell a stopwatch. But the DURATION IS THE CONTRACT on `route.failover|fo|primary-slow` --
# the cell exists because the attempt ran past busbar's cap -- so dropping it entirely would put the
# cell back where it was, named for something it does not record.
#
# The bucket is the resolution at which the fact is busbar's and not the machine's. The boundaries
# are chosen against what the harness actually produces, not round numbers for their own sake: every
# healthy mock response is single-digit milliseconds, and the `slow` verb sleeps
# ORACLE_MOCK_SLOW_SECS (default 8). So `<1s` and `>5s` are separated by three orders of magnitude
# of headroom, and no cell can cross a boundary because a runner was busy. `1-5s` is the middle
# nothing should land in: a healthy attempt that reaches it is a real slowdown and SHOULD move the

# changed between those runs; the number is a fact about when the scrape landed relative to N

#

# ── WS FRAMES: WHAT A SESSION SAYS, WITH ONLY THE NONCES TAKEN OUT ───────────────────────────────
# A `ws` cell's contract is its TRANSCRIPT: the ordered frames, both directions, and the close. Every
# real dialect stamps those frames with values that are new on every run — an OpenAI Realtime event
# carries a fresh `event_id`, a response and an item carry ids minted per turn, a Twilio media
# message carries a `streamSid` and a millisecond `timestamp`, and every one of them carries audio.
# Recorded raw, a session golden is a nonce: it can never be reproduced, so it can never be a diff.
#
# THE DIALECT'S CANONICALISER IS DATA, KEYED BY DIALECT NAME. There is no `if dialect == "openai"`
# anywhere below: `norm_ws` reads a row out of WS_DIALECTS and knows nothing about any provider.
# Adding a dialect is adding a row — the same shape the mock's WS_DIALECTS uses for the other end of
# the same socket — and a dialect this table does not know is LOUD (`ws.dialect-unknown` joins
# `applied`, which is itself the norm.rules diff class) rather than quietly recorded as a nonce.
#
# IDS ARE INTERNED, NOT BLANKED. Replacing every id with one `<ID>` would throw away the thing the
# transcript is for: `response.text.delta` and `response.done` naming the SAME `response_id` is how
# a reader knows they are one turn, and two turns interleaved on one socket is a real bug that a
# single placeholder would hide. Each distinct value gets the next `<ID:n>` in first-appearance
# (wire) order, across the whole session and across every id key and pointer at once — so the
# correlation survives, the nonce does not, and a door that started reusing an id is a diff.
#
# AUDIO IS LENGTH AND DIGEST. A base64 audio payload is tens of kilobytes of bytes nobody will read,
# and a golden full of them is unreviewable; but dropping it entirely would mean a door that sent
# silence, or truncated a turn, recorded identically to one that did not. `{"bytes": N, "sha256":
# …}` keeps exactly the two facts that are a contract. This is neutral, not per-dialect: every
# BINARY frame is treated this way whatever the dialect, because a binary frame on a realtime
# session is audio by construction. Which TEXT keys carry base64 audio is the dialect's business,
# and lives in its row.
