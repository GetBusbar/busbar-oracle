# Script-driver cell `billing|rate-card|history-mid-window` (tracker M7; design
# docs/design/rate-card-history.md §11.2 cell 1; PB-103).
#
# WHAT IT ASKS. `billing|rate-card|epoch-mid-window` already recorded what ONE mid-window card edit
# does to ONE read: the whole ledger comes back at the new card. This cell asks the question that
# one cannot: what happens to the SAME request as the window goes on. Two complete cards are written
# into one window with a chat either side of each, and /api/v1/admin/usage is read after EVERY
# write — so the first request's price is observed three times, under three different current cards.
#
#   chat1                       (boot card:  input 100000 / output 200000 per token)
#   PUT /config/settings        card A: 10x the boot card, complete, no per-request fee
#   GET /admin/usage            -> usage_after_a
#   chat2
#   PUT /config/settings        card B: 100x the boot card + a 3-cent per_request_fee
#   GET /admin/usage            -> usage_after_b
#   chat3
#   GET /admin/usage            -> usage_final
#
# WHY THE SCRIPT DRIVER AND NOT `pre`. record.sh's run_pre_request is UNRECORDED by construction: it
# checks only that busbar answered, never what it answered. The finding here is the RELATION between
# the three reads, so an http cell could record only the last one and would have to assert the other
# two in prose — which is exactly the kind of claim the oracle exists to replace with bytes.
#
# WHY THE FIGURES ARE THESE FIGURES. The mock answers every request with the same 11 in / 7 out, so
# one request costs 11*100000 + 7*200000 = 2,500,000 micro-units under the BOOT card, 25,000,000
# under card A, and 11*10,000,000 + 7*20,000,000 + a 3-cent fee (30,000 micro-units) = 250,030,000
# under card B. The three hypotheses therefore separate arithmetically at each read rather than
# merely differing:
#
#   usage_after_a   read-time reprice: 25,000,000  |  priced-at-charge: 2,500,000
#   usage_after_b   read-time reprice: 500,060,000 |  priced-at-charge: 27,500,000
#   usage_final     read-time reprice: 750,090,000 |  priced-at-charge: 277,530,000
#                                                  |  1.6.0 history:    277,530,000
#
# The priced-at-charge column IS the 1.6.0 answer for this sequence, which is the point: the cell is
# recorded from 1.5.5 now so that when M6 lands, the move is a diff on a golden that predates it.
#
# UNITS, since they are not the same field to field: `rate_card`'s *_utok are MICRO-units per token,
# `spend_micros` is micro-units, and `per_request_fee` is an i64 in CENTS (1 cent = 10,000 micros).
# The `oracle` group's 1,000,000/day budget is in cents; the largest read here is 750,090,000 micros
# = 75,009 cents, so no request in this cell is ever refused at Admit for budget. That is checked,
# not assumed: every chat's status is recorded, so a 429 would be visible in the cell body rather
# than quietly costing the window a row.
#
# COMPLETE CARDS ON PURPOSE. 1.5.5 refuses a partial card with a 400 ("rate_card is AUTHORITATIVE
# and COMPLETE") — see the sibling cell `config|rate-card|append-not-replace`, which records that
# refusal — and a history cell whose writes were refused would record the boot card three times and
# call that a finding. Both PUT statuses are in the body for exactly that reason.
#
# Writes $RAW/captured.json: status = 0 once all steps ran, body = the whole result object (so the
# cell body IS the contract), effects = the same fields individually.
